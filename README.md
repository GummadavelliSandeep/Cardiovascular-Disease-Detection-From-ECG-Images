### Abstract:

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is important tool for identifying cardiovascular issues. Traditionally, ECG records were paper-based, making manual analysis diffcult and time-consuming. By digitizing these records, we can automate diagnosis and analysis processes. This project aims to utilize image processing and machine learning to convert ECG images into a 1-D signal. It focuses on extracting key components like P, QRS, and T waves, representing heart electrical activity. This automated feature extraction can facilitate the diagnosis of various cardiac conditions, 
enhancing medical analysis and decision-making.

### Datasets:
##### Do refer to the link to navigate to ECG Datasets of both Healthy individuals and cardiovascular problems [Click here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gwbz3fsgp8/2 )

### Getting Started:

- Download and install Python 3.5 version.
- Open the cloned folder in VSCode
- Open colabs folder and Set all paths in the code to your local path as I did it in code
- Execute all three codes in that folder
- After executing the code, open the terminal and navigate to the Deployment folder.
- Use the command streamlit run final_app.py to run the application.
